Python Lists

List

Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable.

Lists are created using square brackets:

List items are ordered, changeable, and allow duplicate values.

#dublicate
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "apple", "cherry"]
print(thislist)

If you add new items to a list, the new items will be placed at the end of the list.
